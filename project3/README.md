## Project Outline:



In this project, we provide code that runs the simulator in DV and LS protocol for Bisco GSR9999. We also implement the ping pong to calculate distance cost periodically. All alarms are set and checked for regular updates. We designed our own tests and have included the description in the test.txt file.
