We tested our code through multiple test cases for both DV and LS protocols.

Except for the simpletest 1 & 2 provided as default test cases, we designed our own test csses.


(1) addtest1

In addtest1, we test if our code can handle poison reverse before and after changedelay

(2) addtest2

In addtest2, we test if our code can handle poison reverse with linkdying and linkcomingup

(3) addtest3

In addtest3, we used a slightly large graph to test Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
